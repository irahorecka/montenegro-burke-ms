# ms2-fragpeak-analysis
Extract and analyze metabolite fragmentation peaks from an LC-MS QTOF instrument

# Background
This repository is to analyze fragmentation peaks of metabolite standards during my second rotation in Rafa Montenegro-Burke's lab (Fall 2021). Of the metabolites found and ran on the instrument, 20 were extracted successfully using the Agilent Qualitative Analysis B.07.00 software.

The goal of this repository is to create a simple summary file of the extracted peaks, sorting each fragmentation peak as relative abundance to other peaks within the same sample. If done correctly, this should provide a simple, curated output to make the process of subsequent fragmentation peak database querying and analysis facile.
